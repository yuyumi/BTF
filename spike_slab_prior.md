# Spike and Slab Prior: Mathematical Understanding

## Overview

The spike and slab prior is a fundamental tool in Bayesian variable selection and sparse modeling, particularly useful for nonparametric regression problems. This document outlines our understanding based on the mathematical definition from Hoffmann, Rousseau, and Schmidt-Hieber.

## Mathematical Definition

### Basic Structure

For a bounded density g(x) on ℝ that satisfies:
```
inf_{x∈[-L₀,L₀]} g(x) > 0
```
for some L₀ > 0, we define a family of priors on Θ = ℓ²(Λ).

### Hierarchical Parameter Generation

**Resolution Levels**: Set J_n = [log n / log 2], where n/2 < 2^{J_n} ≤ n

**For j ≤ J_n and k ∈ I_j**, the parameters θ_{j,k} are drawn independently from:
```
π_j(dx) = (1 - w_{j,n})δ₀(dx) + w_{j,n}g(x)dx
```

**For j > J_n**: π_j(dx) = δ₀(dx), or equivalently, θ_{j,k} = 0

### Weight Constraints

The mixture weights w_{j,n} satisfy:
```
n^{-K} ≤ w_{j,n} ≤ 2^{-j(1+τ)}
```
for constants K > 0, τ > 1/2, and all j ≤ J_n.

## Key Components

### 1. Spike Component
- **Definition**: Point mass at zero δ₀(dx)
- **Interpretation**: Represents irrelevant/unselected parameters
- **Probability**: (1 - w_{j,n})

### 2. Slab Component  
- **Definition**: Continuous distribution g(x)dx
- **Interpretation**: Distribution when parameter is "active" or selected
- **Probability**: w_{j,n}
- **Constraint**: g(x) must be bounded away from zero on [-L₀, L₀]

### 3. Mixture Weights w_{j,n}
- **Decreasing with resolution**: Higher j → lower w_{j,n} → more sparsity
- **Sample size dependent**: Depends on n through the bounds
- **Adaptive cutoff**: Beyond J_n, all weights become zero

## Hierarchical Structure

### Multi-Resolution Parameter Generation

1. **Coarse Levels (small j)**:
   - Higher w_{j,n} values
   - More probability of non-zero parameters
   - Represent important, large-scale features

2. **Fine Levels (moderate j ≤ J_n)**:
   - Lower w_{j,n} values  
   - Increasing sparsity
   - Represent detailed, fine-scale features

3. **Beyond Cutoff (j > J_n)**:
   - w_{j,n} = 0 (pure spike)
   - All parameters forced to zero
   - Complete sparsity at finest scales

### Adaptive Complexity

- **Resolution cutoff J_n**: Increases with sample size n
- **Model complexity**: Automatically adapts to available data
- **Sparsity pattern**: More data allows for more complex models

## Theoretical Properties

### Sparsity Favoring

The constraint w_{j,n} ≤ 2^{-j(1+τ)} implies:
- Individual probability of being non-null decreases exponentially with resolution level
- Prior favors sparse models
- Automatic variable selection at multiple scales

### Posterior Concentration

The framework provides:
- Adaptive posterior concentration rates
- Theoretical guarantees for parameter estimation
- Optimal convergence properties for nonparametric regression

## Restriction on g(x)

### The Boundedness Condition

The requirement inf_{x∈[-L₀,L₀]} g(x) > 0 ensures:

1. **Non-degeneracy**: The slab component cannot become arbitrarily close to a point mass at zero
2. **Separation from spike**: Meaningful distinction between spike (δ₀) and slab (g(x))
3. **Sufficient density near zero**: g(x) has adequate mass in a neighborhood of zero

### Valid Examples of g(x)

- **Uniform distribution** on [-a, a] for a > L₀
- **Normal distribution** N(0, σ²) for any σ > 0
- **Laplace distribution** with any scale parameter
- **Any bounded density** that doesn't vanish near zero

### Invalid Examples

- Very narrow Gaussian approaching a point mass
- Any density that goes to zero as x approaches zero
- Distributions with insufficient support around zero

## Application to Nonparametric Regression

### Parameter Interpretation

The generated θ_{j,k} parameters serve as:
- **Coefficients in basis expansions** (wavelets, Fourier, etc.)
- **Multi-scale representation** of the true regression function
- **Adaptive model selection** across different resolutions

### Regression Model Structure

- **Hierarchical coefficients**: Different importance at different scales
- **Automatic sparsity**: Model selects relevant scales and coefficients
- **Sample size adaptation**: Model complexity grows appropriately with n

## Implications for Transformer Learning

### What the Transformer Learns

1. **Sparse coefficient sequences**: Predicting which θ_{j,k} are zero vs non-zero
2. **Multi-resolution structure**: Understanding which scales matter
3. **Adaptive model complexity**: How complexity should scale with sample size
4. **Variable selection patterns**: Learning sparsity patterns across resolutions

### Training Objectives

- **Sequence modeling**: Learn to generate sparse parameter sequences
- **Hierarchical dependencies**: Capture relationships across resolution levels  
- **Bayesian inference**: Approximate posterior distributions over parameters
- **Nonparametric adaptation**: Handle varying model complexity

## Implementation Considerations

### Key Components to Implement

1. **Weight generation**: Sample w_{j,n} satisfying the constraints
2. **Resolution cutoff**: Determine J_n based on sample size n
3. **Spike-slab sampling**: Generate θ_{j,k} from mixture distribution
4. **Slab distribution**: Choose appropriate g(x) satisfying boundedness condition
5. **Log probability computation**: Compute log π_j(θ_{j,k}) for training

### Parameters to Configure

- **Constants K, τ**: Control weight constraints and sparsity rate
- **Slab distribution g(x)**: Choice of continuous component
- **Boundedness parameter L₀**: Lower bound for g(x) density
- **Resolution indexing**: Structure of I_j (coefficient indices at level j)

## Connection to Bayesian Nonparametrics

This spike and slab prior framework provides a principled approach to:
- **Adaptive model selection** in high-dimensional settings
- **Automatic determination of model complexity**
- **Hierarchical shrinkage** with theoretical guarantees
- **Optimal posterior concentration rates** for nonparametric regression

The transformer learns to navigate this complex prior structure, effectively becoming a neural approximation to Bayesian inference in nonparametric regression models.
